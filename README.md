I recently designed an interactive Looker Studio dashboard to analyze student performance across multiple dimensions, helping educators and decision-makers uncover meaningful insights.

🔍 Key Highlights from the Dashboard:

 1️⃣ Education Level & Performance – Clear comparisons of math, reading, and writing scores segmented by parental education levels. This highlights how educational background can influence student outcomes.

2️⃣ Gender-Based Analysis – Visual breakdowns show variations in performance between male and female students, not only by subject but also across total and average scores.

3️⃣ Ethnicity Insights – Group-level score comparisons reveal patterns in performance across diverse student populations, ensuring inclusivity in understanding academic achievement.

4️⃣ Total & Average Score Funnels – A funnel view tracks progression across groups, giving a quick snapshot of where performance strengths and gaps exist.

📈 Why This Matters:

 Such dashboards empower schools, policymakers, and researchers to:

 ✔ Identify performance gaps

 ✔ Focus resources on underperforming groups
